# Colour Cycle Button

This project features a React colour cycling button that follows the brief by taking an array of colours and handling its own cycling. I’ve added a dynamic gradient background and a subtle film grain overlay to give it a modern, engaging feel. 

With my e-commerce experience from taizte.com, I’m passionate about creating intuitive, visually appealing interfaces—and I’d love to bring that creative spark to Silvertreebrands - which itself is in the e-commerce industry.
